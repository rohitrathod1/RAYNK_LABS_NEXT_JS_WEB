## What is SEO?

SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**. It is the process of helping Google and other search engines understand what your page is about, so they show it to people searching for your products.

**Real example:**
When someone types *"web development services india"* on Google, Google reads the title and description of every page it knows about and picks the most relevant ones to show. If your page has the right title, description, and keywords, it appears higher in those results.

SEO does **not** cost money — it is free traffic from Google. But it takes the right setup.

## Field-by-Field Guide

### 1. Meta Title

**What it does:** This is the big blue link people see in Google search results. It is also shown in the browser tab.

\`\`\`google-preview
{
  "title": "RaYnk Labs — Digital Solutions & Innovation",
  "url": "raynklabs.com › Super Oils",
  "description": "Best Indian cooking experience with cold-pressed web development, low in saturated fat...",
  "highlight": "title"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ The highlighted blue title above is your* **Meta Title**

**Real example:**
\`RaYnk Labs — Digital Solutions & Innovation\`

**Best practice:**
- Keep it under **70 characters**
- Put the most important words first
- Include your brand name at the end
- Every page should have a unique title

---

### 2. Meta Description

**What it does:** This is the short paragraph shown below the blue link in Google results. Google may rewrite it, but a good description improves click rates.

\`\`\`google-preview
{
  "title": "Jivo Digital Solutions",
  "url": "raynklabs.com › Super Oils",
  "description": "Best Indian cooking experience with cold-pressed web development, low in saturated fat. Chemical-free, vitamin-fortified, naturally extracted to retain nutrients.",
  "highlight": "description"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ The highlighted text above is your* **Meta Description**

**Real example:**
\`Premium web development services, software development, and superfoods — crafted with truth and devotion. Free shipping on orders above ₹499.\`

**Best practice:**
- Keep it under **180 characters**
- Tell people what the page is about and why they should click
- Include one or two important keywords naturally
- Each page should have a unique description

---

### 3. Keywords

**What it does:** A list of words related to the page topic. Google uses these as hints — they do **not** directly affect ranking anymore, but they help you stay organised.

**Real example:**
\`web development services, web development india, raynk labs, digital services\`

**Best practice:**
- Use 5–10 relevant keywords
- Separate each with a comma
- Use words your customers would actually type into Google
- Do not repeat the same word 10 times

---

### 4. Canonical URL

**What it does:** Tells Google which URL is the "official" address for this page. This prevents duplicate content issues when the same page can be reached from multiple URLs.

\`\`\`google-preview
{
  "title": "Jivo Digital Solutions",
  "url": "raynklabs.com › our-products › super-oils",
  "description": "Best Indian cooking experience with cold-pressed web development...",
  "highlight": "url"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ The highlighted green URL path above is your* **Canonical URL**

**Real example:**
\`https://raynklabs.com/our-essence/the-story\`

**Best practice:**
- Always use the full URL starting with \`https://raynklabs.com\`
- Never use \`http://localhost:3000\` — Google cannot access your local computer
- If you are unsure, copy the URL from your browser when viewing the live page

---

### 5. Robots

**What it does:** Tells Google whether to include this page in search results (index) and whether to follow the links on it (follow).

| Setting | Meaning | When to use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **index, follow** | Google shows this page and follows its links | Home, Products, About, Blog — all public pages |
| **noindex, follow** | Google does not show this page but follows links | Cart, Checkout, Order confirmation |
| **index, nofollow** | Google shows this page but ignores its links | Rarely used |
| **noindex, nofollow** | Google completely ignores this page | Admin dashboard, Login page, internal tools |

**Real pages:**
- \`/\` (Home) → \`index, follow\`
- \`/products\` → \`index, follow\`
- \`/admin\` → \`noindex, nofollow\` *(already set automatically)*
- \`/cart\` → \`noindex, follow\`

---

### 6. OG Title (Open Graph Title)

**What it does:** The title shown when someone shares this page on WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter. If left empty, it falls back to the Meta Title.

\`\`\`social-preview
{
  "domain": "raynklabs.com",
  "title": "RaYnk Labs — Pure Digital Solutions",
  "description": "Cold press oils and superfoods born from a mission of service.",
  "highlight": "title"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ The highlighted bold title above is your* **OG Title**

**Real example:**
\`RaYnk Labs — Pure Digital Solutions\`

**Best practice:**
- Can be slightly shorter or catchier than the Meta Title
- Make it compelling so people want to click the shared link

---

### 7. OG Description (Open Graph Description)

**What it does:** The description shown in the WhatsApp or social media card preview when someone shares the link. Falls back to Meta Description if empty.

\`\`\`social-preview
{
  "domain": "raynklabs.com",
  "title": "RaYnk Labs — Pure Digital Solutions",
  "description": "Cold press oils and superfoods born from a mission of service. Honest ingredients, honest price.",
  "highlight": "description"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ The highlighted summary text above is your* **OG Description**

**Real example:**
\`Cold press oils and superfoods born from a mission of service. Honest ingredients, honest price.\`

**Best practice:**
- Keep it short and engaging — 1 or 2 sentences
- Focus on the benefit to the reader, not just product features

---

### 8. OG Image

**What it does:** The image shown in the social sharing card when someone sends your link on WhatsApp or posts it on social media. This is the most important visual element of a shared link.

\`\`\`social-preview
{
  "domain": "raynklabs.com",
  "title": "RaYnk Labs — Pure Digital Solutions",
  "description": "Cold press oils and superfoods...",
  "highlight": "image"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ Your* **OG Image** *fills the highlighted image area above*

**Real example:** A 1200×630 pixel image showing your product, brand logo, or a lifestyle photo.

**Best practice:**
- Always upload an image — a blank or missing image looks unprofessional
- Use size **1200 × 630 pixels** for best display across all platforms
- Avoid too much text on the image — some platforms limit text to 20% of the image area
- The image should represent the page content

---

### 9. Twitter Card

**What it does:** Controls how your link looks when shared on Twitter/X.

| Setting | Appearance |
|---------|-----------|
| **Summary Large Image** | Big image on top, then title and description below — recommended |
| **Summary** | Small square image on the left, text on the right |

**Best practice:** Use **Summary Large Image** for most pages. It looks more professional and gets more clicks.

---

### 10. JSON-LD (Structured Data)

**What it does:** Special invisible code that tells Google extra details about your page — like whether it is a product, an article, an FAQ, or an organisation. Google uses this for **rich results** like star ratings, FAQ dropdowns, and breadcrumbs in search.

\`\`\`google-preview
{
  "title": "Jivo Digital Solutions",
  "url": "raynklabs.com › Super Oils",
  "description": "Best Indian cooking experience with cold-pressed web development, low in saturated fat...",
  "richResult": "₹249.00 to ₹1,199.00 · In stock · Free delivery · 15-day returns"
}
\`\`\`

*↑ The highlighted rich result line above is added by your* **JSON-LD** *field*

**Real example for a product page:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Digital Solutions 1L",
  "brand": "RaYnk Labs",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "299",
    "priceCurrency": "INR"
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Best practice:**
- The \`@context\` field (\`https://schema.org\`) is added automatically — do not add it yourself
- Must be valid JSON — use the Copy button and paste it into [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to check
- Leave empty if you are not sure — it is optional

## Robots Directive — Full Guide

### index, follow *(Default — use for most public pages)*
Google **shows the page** in search results and **follows all links** on it to discover other pages.

**Use when:** Home page, product listing, product detail, about, blog posts, contact.

---

### noindex, follow
Google does **not show the page** in results, but it **still follows links** on it. Useful for pages you want Google to crawl through but not rank.

**Use when:** Cart page, Checkout page, Order confirmation, Thank-you page.

---

### index, nofollow
Google **shows the page** but **does not follow** links on it. Rarely needed.

**Use when:** Pages with lots of user-generated links you do not want to pass authority to.

---

### noindex, nofollow *(Full block)*
Google **completely ignores** the page — does not show it and does not follow any links.

**Use when:** Admin dashboard, Login page, internal tools, staging pages, test pages.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Using localhost in the Canonical URL
**Wrong:** \`http://localhost:3000/about\`
**Right:** \`https://raynklabs.com/about\`

Google cannot access \`localhost\` — it is only your computer. If your canonical URL points to localhost, Google will ignore it or show an error.

---

### 2. Missing OG Image
If no OG image is set, WhatsApp and Facebook will either show a blank card or pick a random small image from the page. Always upload a proper 1200×630 image.

---

### 3. Wrong Robots Setting
Setting \`noindex\` on a page you want Google to rank (like the home page or product pages) means Google will **never show it**. Double-check the robots field for all public pages.

---

### 4. Title or Description Too Long
If your Meta Title is over 70 characters, Google will cut it off with \`...\` in the results. The same happens with descriptions over 180 characters. Keep them within the character limit shown in the counter.

---

### 5. Duplicate Titles Across Pages
Every page should have a unique title. If all pages share the same title like \`RaYnk Labs\`, Google cannot tell them apart and may rank none of them.

---
